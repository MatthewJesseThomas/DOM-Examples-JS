    <h1 id="para1" style="color: #6a0dad; font-style: oblique;">Peace is a lie, there is only passion. 
                  Through passion, I gain strength. 
                  Through strength, I gain power. 
                  Through power, I gain victory.</h1>
    <h1 id="para2" style="color: #5ebac9; font-style: oblique;">There must be both dark and light. 
                  I will do what I must to keep the balance, as the balance is what holds all life. There is no good without evil, but evil must not be allowed to flourish. 
                  There is passion, yet peace; serenity, yet emotion; chaos, yet order.</h1>
